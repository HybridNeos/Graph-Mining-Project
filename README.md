# Graph-Mining-Project
Graph application of in development TFRRS API

## Reproduction
Code is not a tidy as can be. The file trackTest.py can extract data from TFRRS and eventGroups.py gives a template for 
getting information from school rosters. A lot of manual data engineering has to go occur to joining the data.

The file quickGraph contains code to generate the graph and do set cover operations. The file eventClassification handles
the learning problem.

Used data is stored in fullDetail.csv
